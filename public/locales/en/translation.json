I'm quite sociable, so I'll tell you a little about myself. <br /><br /> My name is <b>Kyrylo</b>, and since early childhood I have been interested in the architecture and principle of operation of the computer and the activities associated with it. So I entered the STEP Academy, where I learned how to work with a computer and mastered various professions, thanks to which we now have all the conveniences of working and advertising on the Internet.<br /><br />Having studied everything from computer design to web design programming and other things, I am keen on development of web products and the creation of their design the most. Therefore, I decided to make this type of activity my main type of income. I have taken many courses related to this industry and now I am studying at the National Technical University «Kharkiv Polytechnical Institute» majoring in computer science.<br /><br />Now I am just starting my journey, but I am sure that I will become successful and improve every day. And little info about my language skills. I speak English at B2 level, also i can talk on native Ukranian and Russian. Always ready to learn something new and become better!<br /><br />Further more."
